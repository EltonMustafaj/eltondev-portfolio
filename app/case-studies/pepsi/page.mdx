# 🧾 Case Study: Pepsi Albania – Interactive Product Showcase

## 🛠 Problem

Pepsi needed a modern, engaging web presence for the Albanian market that could showcase their product lineup in an interactive and visually appealing way. The challenge was to create an experience that:
- Captures the bold, energetic essence of the Pepsi brand
- Provides an immersive product exploration experience
- Works seamlessly across all devices
- Engages users with smooth animations and transitions

## 💡 Solution

I developed an interactive product showcase website featuring:
- **Smooth Scroll Experience**: Engaging scroll-triggered animations that reveal content dynamically
- **Product Selection**: Interactive product cards for Pepsi Classic and Pepsi Max
- **Modern Design**: Clean, bold typography with Albanian language support ("MËMË SHUMË SE NJË PIJE")
- **Responsive Layout**: Optimized experience across desktop, tablet, and mobile devices
- **High-Quality Visuals**: Stunning product photography with 3D can renders and lifestyle imagery

The site creates an immersive journey that encourages users to explore different Pepsi products while maintaining fast load times and smooth performance.

## 💭 Reflection

This project was an excellent opportunity to combine creative design with technical performance. The biggest challenge was maintaining smooth animations while ensuring fast load times, especially for the high-quality product images. By leveraging Next.js Image optimization and carefully choreographing animations with Framer Motion, we achieved both visual impact and technical excellence.

The Albanian localization required attention to detail in typography and cultural nuances, ensuring the messaging resonated with the local audience while staying true to Pepsi's global brand identity.
